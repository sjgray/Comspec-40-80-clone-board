Comspec 40/80-S2 board Clone
============================

This is a clone of the Comspec 40/80 S2 board for PET/CBM computers.
This board allows the PET to switch between real 40 or 80 column video modes.
Whe the board is switched the computer is reset. These boards were supplied
with both 40 and 80 column Editor ROMs combined into a single EPROM. A wire
from the Comspec board to the upper address pin of the EPROM automatically
selected the correct ROM for the selected video mode.
